The "libft" is a C library developed by students from the 42 programming school. In this project I recreate various standard functions from the C library entirely from scratch, without relying on any pre-existing functions provided by the standard C library. In addition to replicating these essential functions, the "libft" also includes a variety of extra features including memory manipulation, array searching and sorting, string manipulation, basic mathematical operations, file handling, and much more. To perform these tasks, it's crucial to have a strong understanding of fundamental programming concepts, such as conditional logic, loops, and data structures.

The main goal of this project is to understand basic C operations better while improving problem-solving and programming skills. Building the 'libft' demands efficiency and precision, following the strict guidelines and standards outlined by 42.

This challenging experience not only elevates my technical proficiency but also equips me to confront intricate challenges in the programming world. Constructing this essential library amplifies my comprehension of C language intricacies, equipping me with the confidence and expertise to excel as a proficient programmer.
