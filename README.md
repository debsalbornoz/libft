<h2>About </h2>

Libft is a C library developed by students from the 42 programming school. This project involves the recreation of various standard functions from the C library entirely from scratch, without relying on any pre-existing functions provided by the standard C library. In addition to replicating these essential functions, Libft also includes additional features such as memory manipulation, array searching and sorting, string manipulation, basic mathematical operations, and file handling.

To undertake these tasks, a strong understanding of fundamental programming concepts, such as conditional logic, loops, and data structures, is crucial. The primary objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of basic C operations while enhancing problem-solving and programming skills. Building Libft requires efficiency and precision, adhering strictly to the guidelines and standards outlined by 42.

This challenging experience not only enhances technical proficiency but also equips programmers to tackle intricate challenges in the programming world. Constructing this essential library amplifies comprehension of C language intricacies, providing programmers with the confidence and expertise to excel as proficient programmers.

<h2>How to use</h2>
